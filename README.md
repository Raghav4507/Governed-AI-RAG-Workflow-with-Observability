# Governed-AI-RAG-Workflow-with-Observability
## Overview

This project implements a production-ready, governed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that ingests PDF documents, performs semantic retrieval using vector embeddings stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector), applies governance guardrails, generates responses using GPT-4.1, and logs performance + token metrics for observability through a BI dashboard.

The system demonstrates full AI workflow engineering — from ingestion to monitoring — with a focus on safety, performance tracking, and production-minded design.
